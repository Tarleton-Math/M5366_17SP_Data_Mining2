They need their own AWS account first.  Next they will need to go to:
 
https://www.awseducate.com
 
and scroll down to the link on the right that says “Apply for AWS Educate for Students”.   Next they will choose their “Role” (Student).  On the screen after that they’ll enter Tarleton State University in the “Institution Name” field (it will auto fill after they typed a part of Tarleton State).  They’ll need to fill out the rest – Country, City, Filed of Study, First Name, Last name and Email address.  They’ll also need their AWS Account ID which they should already have.  I’m not sure what happens after that.  I suspect I may need to approve the “Application”.
