    "Web scraping is a task related to gathering data from the web; this might include text, numbers, images, videos, etc...  \n",
    "The process of web scraping is simple:\n",
    "1. download the web page\n",
    "2. extract stuff from the web page\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the process is simple but web pages are messy. Behind the hood of those pretty web sites we look at is a lot of structuring that's put in place by markup languages like HTML and CSS. This messiness, like in the image below, is typically hard to parse for someone who isn't familiar with building websites.\n",

    "<img src=\"raw-html.png\" alt=\"raw html\" style=\"width: 70%; height: 70%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's why we have Python packages :).\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used a lot in the real world for many purposes: to store data in databases for later analysis, to make on-the-fly decisions (like buying stocks), or creating a bot that retrieves the news and tries to summarize it for you in a paragraph or less. We've personally used web scraping to help small to medium sized businesses collect more data, make more data-driven decisions, and to automate a lot of mundane processes."
